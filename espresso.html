        <ol>
            <li>Grind your coffee beans of choice on a fine grind.</li>
            <li>Fill group handle with grounds and tamp down the contents.</li>
            <li>Place group handle in group head and set the espresso to brew.</li>
            <li>Shots should pull for approximately 25 seconds, resulting in dark colored espresso and a thin line of pale brown crema at the top.</li>
            <li>Note: Espresso is best enjoyed within 2-3 minutes of the shot being pulled. After this time frame, the shot will "die" (if not already added to some sort of espresso drink), resulting in a slightly ashy taste.</li>
            <li>Enjoy!</li>
