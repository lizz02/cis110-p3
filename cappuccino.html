    <h1>How to Make A Cappuccino</h1>
    </div>
    <div class="steps">
        <ol>
            <li>Pour around 8oz of milk into a pitcher.</li>
            <li>Submerge the steam wand completely in the milk before turning the wand on.</li>
            <li>Angle the pitcher so that the content begin to swirl and begin to aerate the milk, carefully pulling the pitcher back at an angle until a tearing sound can be heard. Aerate for roughly 6-8 seconds.</li>
            <li>Continue to steam milk until it is at your preferred temperature. When finished, tap the pitcher gently against the counter so the foam settles.</li>
            <li>Pull a shot of <a href="espresso.html">espresso</a>. While, the shot is pulling, add any sweetener you would prefer to your mug.</li>
            <li>When the shot has finished pouring, add the contents to your mug, swirling slightly to mix in any sweetener.</li>
            <li>Pour milk and continue swirling to ensure the contents are thoroughly mixed.</li>
            <li>Clean steam wand, wiping it down and turning it back on for a moment to dispose of any residual milk.</li>
            <li>Note: Depending how strong you prefer your espresso drinks, the milk/espresso ratio will vary.</li>
            <li>Enjoy!</li>
