        <ol>
            <li>Grind your coffee beans of choice on medium grind.</li>
            <li>Heat just over 12oz of water (filtered is recommended).</li>
            <li>Place a coffee filter over your glass. Soak the filter with hot water and empty any excess from your mug.</li>
            <li>Measure 3 tablespoons of grounds into the filter.</li>
            <li>Pour enough water so that the grounds are wet and then allow it to drain for a few seconds. Then, pour the remaining water into the filter. This should create a blooming effect, causing a light brown foam to emerge from the grounds after the water is added.</li>
            <li>Wait a few minutes for all the water to drain through the filter into your mug.</li>
            <li>Enjoy!</li>
